# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. Weâ€™ve been tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
